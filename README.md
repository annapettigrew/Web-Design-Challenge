# Web-Design-Challenge

I built a dashboard, and created individual pages for each plot as a way to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and description. I also built a landing page to provide a comparison of all the plots, along with another page to present the data used to build them.

This website Includes
A landing page containing the following elements:
An explanation of the project
Links to each visualizations page. And a sidebar containing preview images of each plot. Clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.

Four visualization pages with each with the following elements:
A descriptive title and heading tag.
Plots for the selected comparison (latitude vs: max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, or wind speed).
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that does the following:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page
Used Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.


A "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.


I used the weather data I collected for the WeatherPy section of your Python-APIs challenge.
I also used CSS Elements to draft the styling
